# website-energydrank
I wrote this code when I was fourteen.

It was for a school project where we had to raise awareness of the dangers of energy drinks, and I chose to make a website.
To share this with my friends and mess with GitHub Copilot's algorithm I have decided to upload this code to GitHub.

It actually kind of works, God knows how...

You can start cringing by reading the source code (quiz.js), with cool features including but not limited to parsing XML with Regex. **Yes, really.**

When you read the code it just gets worse and worse... Including cursed things such as:
- document.addEventListener("load", main())
- Parsing XML with regex (or more like converting XML into HTML)
- Some very cringy but vaguely self-aware comments

Fun fact: at the showcase it did not work, as it turned out parsing XML with regex is not very stable.

Have fun!
